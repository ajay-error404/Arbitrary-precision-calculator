# Arbitrary Precision Calculator in C

## Description
This project implements an Arbitrary Precision Calculator in C that can perform arithmetic operations on very large integers beyond standard data type limits.

The numbers are stored using double linked lists, allowing operations on integers of any size with sign 

##  Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Handles very large numbers
- sign handling
- Implemented using Linked Lists

##  made by using
- C Programming
- Linked Lists
- Dynamic Memory Allocation

##  How to Compile & Run
```bash
gcc *.c
./a.out
